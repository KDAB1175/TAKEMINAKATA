# The Box

I have designed The Box into which the TAKEMINAKATA project PCB board will go. I do not guarantee it will fit other boards nor do I guarantee it will fit reworked board or a board with different wiring than in-situ on the pin receptacles.

You can find the model on this link: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9a9f658903be2c3d841b125e/w/bca767fe0202b4a430af9ebe/e/b517bc44d2b5596806e8dc74

Below will be the .stl files for 3D printing.
