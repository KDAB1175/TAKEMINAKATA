# electronics

I have so far inserted two files into this folder. Both are for designing electronic circuits in EasyEDA. As the time will go I will also add compiles for Altium designer
(which I hope will work properly, you guys let me know) and gerber files.

#if you want to edit and play with the files, read this section

For those of you wanting to get a bit more up close and personal with this project, you can edit both of the files so that they are up to your liking. TAKEMINAKATA.json is for schematics design
and PCB_TAKEMINAKATA.json is for the design of the pcb. That is true at least in EasyEDA.

If you want to alter certain parts of the schematic, because there is a problem in them, please let me know. Otherwise, have fun with it. I would also like to point out, that if you were to alter
pinouts of buses and/or connections, you will most likely have to change some parts of future code too.

#if you just want to send the files to the manufacturer and don't worry about it, read this section

For those of you who don't want to get a bit more up close and personal with this project, you can just send the gerber file to pcb manufacturer of your choice. All of them should accept gerber files.
I will add parts list soon for you to buy.
