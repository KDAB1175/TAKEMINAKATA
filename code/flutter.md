# Flutter app code download

To help ensure security of the app, its up-to-date code base and features, anyone can download the flutter code for it and tinker with it. Please pull request if you want to make any changes, and preferably contact me at joshmiriento@gmail.com, so that we can discuss what they are about. Please always provide your github username and the reason for the pull request, thank you.

You can download flutter code from TAKEMINAKATA-flutter repo on this account. The url is: https://github.com/KDAB1175/TAKEMINAKATA-flutter/. I will be making the release apk public soon, as well as publishing the app to the Google Play Store along with downloadable version for iOS. There will also be a website along with desktop apps for Linux and Windows.
